    <h1><center>Health of Humans: The Benefits of Exercise and Athleticism</center></h1>

    <p><strong>Reason</strong> for exercise is to not only lose or gain weight,
      become the best professional in your favorite sport, or become the next
      Arnold; the reason for exercise is to improve your exercise, and thus, to improve
      your own health. Science has associated exercise and athleticism with happiness
      (endorphins) in life, length of one's life, and the probabilities of people getting
      sick; researchers have found a positive and a direct correlation between
      exercise and positivities of life.</p>

      <p><strong>CAUTION!</strong> If you have not exercised or have not experienced athletic activity in a long time,
        please start out with caution. As you exercise more frequently,
        your body will get used to the pressure and challenges that you put it through; however,
        if you have not exercised in a long time, <strong>DO NOT</strong> attempt or preform high weights, speeds, or lengths.
      Now, onto the better things</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="health">Better <em>Health</em></h2>
      <p>Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
         Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently.
          And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.<br>
        Moreover, studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant
        medication—but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the
        Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for
        an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms,
        research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="energy">Natural <em>Energy</em> Boost</h2>
      <p>Exercise on the regular increases the blood flow to your body and improves your cardiovascular health and fitness.
         Exercise can improve energy levels by strengthening the circulation and the heart muscle, and in return will improve energy levels.
         New research suggests regular exercise can increase energy levels even among people suffering from chronic medical conditions associated with fatigue,
          like cancer and heart disease.</p><br>
      <h2 id="life"><em>Length of Life</em></h2>
      <p>The researchers looked at over 122,000 patients at a large academic medical center who underwent exercise testing on a treadmill, an objective measure
        of CRF. While the average age was 53, participants ranged in age from 18 to over 80. Similar to findings of previous studies, being fit was associated
        with living longer. This held true at any age. The researchers also saw a relationship between CRF and survival rates: the higher the level of fitness,
        the higher the survival rate. This was especially notable in older people and people with high blood pressure. And the survival benefit continued to
        climb with no upper limit.</p>
      <h2 id="happy">Boost of <em>Happiness</em></h2>
      <p>Endorphins are the only “feel-good” chemicals released through exercising though. Your body will also produce serotonin, norepinephrine,
        BDNF and dopamine, the reward chemical. All of which have huge positive benefits for the mind. The bottom line: the combination of these
        five chemicals will boost your mood, and have been proved to help to relieve both anxiety and depression.</p><br>

      <h2> All in all, exercise has tremendous positive effects on you and your body! So, what is stopping you?</h2>
      <p>Exercise is uncomfortable—uncomfortable relative to our typical reality, that is. We live in a society
        where we keep the indoor temperature adjusted to perfection all year round, wrap ourselves in soft clothing,
         wear thick-soled shoes to protect our feet from harm, lay on cushy beds draped in poofy covers, and shower
         and scrub with warm water and soap every single day. Is all of this First-World pampering making us intolerant
         to even mild physical discomfort? Maybe exercise isn't too uncomfortable—maybe our everyday lives are a little too comfortable.</p><br>
